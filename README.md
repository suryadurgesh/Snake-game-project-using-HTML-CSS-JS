# Snake Game üêçüéÆ

This is a classic Snake Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features smooth gameplay, responsive controls, and a simple but elegant design.

## Features
- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using the arrow keys to navigate across the grid.
- **Food Collection**: The snake grows longer each time it eats the food.
- **Score**: Track your current score and aim to beat the max score stored locally.
- **Game Over**: Game ends when the snake collides with itself. Try again by clicking the "RESTART" button.
- **Particle Effects**: Cool particle splash effect when the snake eats food.

## How to Play
1. Press any arrow key to start.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the snake:
   - `Up Arrow`: Move up.
   - `Down Arrow`: Move down.
   - `Left Arrow`: Move left.
   - `Right Arrow`: Move right.
3. Eat the food (red circle) to grow and increase your score.
4. Avoid colliding with the snake's own body.

## Setup
To play the game locally:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snake-game.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML**: For structuring the game elements.

## Future Enhancements
